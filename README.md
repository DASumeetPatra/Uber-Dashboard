# Uber Ride Data Analysis | Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride booking data to understand booking behavior, revenue patterns, and operational efficiency.

The analysis started as a general exploratory study. During exploration, a critical issue was identified — a high ride cancellation rate.  
Based on this insight, the project was extended into a focused cancellation analysis and optimization study.

Both phases are implemented within a **single Power BI file**, logically divided into:
- **DB1 – Exploratory Analysis**
- **DB2 – Cancellation Analysis & Optimization**



## Business Problem
A significant percentage of ride bookings were being cancelled, leading to revenue loss and poor customer experience.

The objective of this project is to:
- Identify cancellation patterns
- Understand root causes
- Propose data-driven solutions to reduce cancellations



## Dashboard Structure

### DB1 – Exploratory Analysis
Purpose: To understand overall business performance and uncover hidden issues.

Includes:
- Booking and revenue KPIs
- Booking status distribution
- Time-based trends (monthly, weekday vs weekend, peak vs non-peak)
- Fare and payment analysis
- Vehicle type and location performance

**Key discovery from DB1:** High cancellation rate ~38%



### DB2 – Cancellation Analysis & Optimization
Purpose: To deep-dive into the cancellation problem identified in DB1.

Includes:
- Driver vs customer cancellation analysis
- Cancellation reasons
- Time-slot and location-based cancellation patterns
- Vehicle-type impact on cancellations
- Identification of cancellation hotspots



## Key Insights
- Approximately **38% of total ride bookings are cancelled**
- Driver-side cancellations contribute more than customer cancellations
- Peak hours and high-demand locations have higher cancellation density
- Economy vehicle types dominate bookings and cancellations
- Medium-distance rides contribute the most to overall revenue



## Recommendations
- Introduce zone- and time-based driver incentives
- Improve driver allocation during peak hours
- Enhance ETA accuracy and in-app communication
- Optimize surge pricing logic
- Reduce dependency on cash payments



## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX
- Excel / CSV
- Data Modeling & Time Intelligence



## Project Files & Access
- Dashboard screenshots are available in the `Dashboards/` folder
- DAX measures (optional) are documented in the `DAX/` folder
- Due to GitHub file size limitations, the Power BI (.pbix) file is hosted externally
