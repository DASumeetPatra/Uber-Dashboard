# Project Approach

## Background
This project started as a general exploratory analysis of Uber ride booking data to understand overall business performance.

## Step 1: Exploratory Analysis (DB1)
-- Built an exploratory dashboard (DB1) to analyze:
  - Total bookings, completed rides, cancellations
  - Time-based trends (monthly, weekday/weekend, peak/non-peak)
  - Fare and revenue patterns
  - Vehicle type and location performance
-- During this phase, a high cancellation rate ~38% was identified.

## Step 2: Problem Identification
-- The cancellation rate was significantly high and posed a major operational and revenue risk.
-- This insight became the core business problem for further analysis.

## Step 3: Deep-Dive Analysis (DB2)
-- Created a second set of dashboards (DB2) focused on:
  - Driver vs customer cancellations
  - Cancellation reasons
  - Time-slot and location-based cancellation patterns
  - Vehicle-type impact on cancellations

## Step 4: Optimization & Recommendations
-- Identified cancellation hotspots by time and location.
-- Proposed data-driven solutions to reduce cancellations and improve platform reliability.

## Outcome
The project evolved from exploration to problem-solving, reflecting a real-world analytics workflow.


# Business Insights & Recommendations

## Key Insights
- Approximately 38% of total ride bookings are cancelled.
- Driver-side cancellations contribute more than customer cancellations.
- Peak hours and high-demand locations show the highest cancellation density.
- Economy vehicle types dominate both bookings and cancellations.
- Medium-distance rides contribute the most to overall revenue.

## Business Impact
- Revenue loss due to unfulfilled bookings.
- Poor customer experience and trust issues.
- Inefficient driver allocation.

## Recommendations
- Introduce zone- and time-based driver incentives.
- Improve driver allocation during peak hours.
- Enhance ETA accuracy and customer-driver communication.
- Optimize surge pricing logic.
- Reduce dependency on cash payments.
